# MALDEV1

This repository contains my personal resources, notes, and practice code related to malware development and reverse engineering, based on the course I am following.

## Purpose
The main goal of this repo is to document my learning process, experiments, and exercises as I work through the course material. It includes:

- Practice C/C++ code for building executables and DLLs
- Experiments with Windows API functions commonly used in malware
- Payload embedding, shellcode, and memory analysis examples
- Notes and scripts for reverse engineering and malware analysis

## Structure
- `01-buildingEXEandDLL/`: Practice projects for building executables and DLLs
- `02-embeddingPayload/`: Experiments with embedding payloads in executables
- Additional folders and files for future topics and exercises

## Tools Used
- Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (C++)
- Oracle VirtualBox, Flare-VM
- Kali Linux (for Metasploit)

## Notes

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
```

## TODO

- Reviewing Generating shellcode using Tetasploit in Kali linux
- New lessons on Embedding shellcode payload in RSRC section
